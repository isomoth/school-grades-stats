# school-grades-stats
Register a student's points in every subject and convert them to grades (according to the Swedish school system).

## Installation

No installations required. Just open the Java class in your IDE of choice (examples: Netbeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ).

## Usage

The program will ask you to fill in the points for each subject. After you do (in the console), it will return the grade as a letter (according to the scale of the Swedish 
National Agency for Education). 

## Contributing

This was just a beginner's exercise in Java. No need for pull requests at the moment. 

## Acknowledgment

This program is based on the curriculum of the course "Programmering 1" by Folkuniversitetet (2021). Only used for educational purposes.
